Interface:
An interface in C# is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only method signatures, properties, events, and indexers. Interfaces cannot contain instance fields and constructors. They are used to define a contract that implementing classes must adhere to.

Abstraction
Abstraction in C# can be achieved using abstract classes and abstract methods. An abstract class can have both abstract methods (without a body) and concrete methods (with a body). Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly.


Key Differences

Purpose:
Interface: Defines a contract that implementing classes must adhere to. It is used for defining the capabilities that classes should provide.
Abstraction: Provides a common base class for other classes to extend and share code. It is used to hide implementation details and to share code among related classes.

Methods:
Interface: Can only have method signatures (until C# 8.0 introduced default implementations). All methods are implicitly abstract and public.
Abstract Class: Can have both abstract methods and concrete methods. It can provide default behavior for methods.

Multiple Inheritance:
Interface: A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for multiple inheritance of type.
Abstract Class: A class can inherit only one abstract class due to single inheritance.

Instantiation:
Interface: Cannot be instantiated directly.
Abstract Class: Cannot be instantiated directly.
